# Good Morning! It's TUESDAY, July 8, 2025.

Progress [#---------]

## Getting into your Virtual Machines

[https://class.hypertheory-labs.com/guacamole/#](https://class.hypertheory-labs.com/guacamole/#)

The first (Guacamole) login is:

- User Name: Student*X* (where X is your assigned student number)
- Password: Hypertheory_Training!

The second (black screen) is:

- Username: student (no number)
- Password: The password you changed to yesterday morning
- Domain: Leave blank

## Today

Review how to reset your code with mine.

Review of yesterday.

Write a System Test for the API `GET /links` endpoint.

Come up with a "testing strategy" - how will we have confidence it works?

### Later

Transition to the C# *death march*.
